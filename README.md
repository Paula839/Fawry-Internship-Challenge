# Fawry Full Stack Development Internship Challenge

This repository contains my solution for the **Fawry Full Stack Development Internship Challenge**. The challenge focuses on designing and implementing a modular and object-oriented **e-commerce system** in Java.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Overview

The task was to simulate an e-commerce system with the following core requirements:

- Support multiple **product types**, each with different behaviors:
  - **Shippable** products (e.g., TVs, Mobiles)
  - **Expirable** products (e.g., Cheese, Biscuits)
  - Products that are both or neither
- Allow **customers** to:
  - Add products to their cart (with quantity and stock constraints)
  - Perform **checkout** operations with balance and expiration validation
- Design a **Shipping Service** that accepts only valid `ShippableProduct` items
- Handle edge cases like:
  - Expired products
  - Out-of-stock items
  - Insufficient customer balance

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- JUnit for unit testing (optional extension)
